RandomPy
=====

Random python scripts that may serve as real life examples of Python
applications. All scripts come from real small experiences and may be
useful for other people as well, especially someone who intends to learn
python or any programming language. They are all commented and there's 
always a readme to explain what the problem was about.

*You will notice that I'm still putting things in order.*

You may very well contact me if you find anything interesting.


About the material
------

I'm an user of emacs, so the scripts should look prettier inside emacs.
Also, everything is written in Python 2.*, using a variety of
libraries commonly found in most of Linux repositories. Finally
though less important I sometimes use Enthought distribution.
