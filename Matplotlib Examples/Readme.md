A few matplotlib examples
=====

Particularly, I always have problems searching for stuff in
Matplotlib's documentaiton. I noticed some other people do as
well. Thus, I decided to leave here some example scripts that I
consider may help someone loocking for some tricks.

Everything I do in these scripts are in the documentation of
matplotlib, so don't expect to find anything here completely
new. However, some scripts may put together a lot of stuff to create,
in the simplest way I could think of, a pretty plot. My main
motivation for doing this is the fact that scripts shared by other
people helped me (and always do!) in the past, so this is my
contribution.
